# Intro to Programming for Recruiters

Recruiters are tasked with hiring programmers. As a tech recruiter, why 
not learn a bit about what programmers do?

These simple lessons will teach you some programming that will be 
immediately useful.

## How to proceed

Start with lesson 01 and work through to the end. Take the time to 
understand lessons as you progress through them. Each lesson builds 
on the last, ending with a useful tool that you can modify and extend 
for your amusement/needs.

This is only the beginning, so I'd strongly encourage levaraging 
other freely available and easily accessible resources to learn more.

Currently, these lessons have only been tested in Chrome. They may 
not work in other browsers. It's assumed throughout the lessons that 
you're using Chrome.
