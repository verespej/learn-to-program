# Lesson 01

Although this appears trivial, it's the foundation of what we'll be 
doing in these lessons.

## About

Look inside lesson01.js. What you see there is some very basic javascript.

We'll be creating a bookmark with the contents of this file. If you're 
unfamiliar, a bookmark is a web link stored by your web browser for 
later reference.

You might be thinking, 'but the file doesn't contain a URL!' That's 
correct. When a 'link' starts with 'javascript:', it tells the browser 
to interpret the link as executable content. That is, run the javascript 
that follows.

`alert` is a function built into javascript. When executed, it opens a 
message box containing the quoted message, which in this case is 
'Yeah! Learning to program!'

## What to do

1. Add the following link to your browser as a bookmark: [javascript: alert('Yeah! Learning to program!');](javascript: alert('Yeah! Learning to program!');)
1. Click on the bookmark (when it's a program instead of a link, we call it a 'bookmarklet')
