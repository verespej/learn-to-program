# Lesson 02

Let's get organized!

```
javascript: (function(){
  alert('Yeah! Learning to program!');
})();
```

## About

Look inside lesson02.js (copied above for convenience). You'll 
see that it's very similar to the content of lesson 01.

The main thing we've added is `function() { }`. You might recall 
from lesson 01, that we referred to `alert` as a function. Using 
`function` allows us to define our own, custom functions. Basically, 
the contents between the `{` and `}` become a reusable piece of 
code.

This is an advanced concept and not important to understand 
fully at the moment. What is important to understand here is that 
the effect of this code is the same as that of lesson 01. However, 
we get further along and things become more complex, wrapping 
everything in a function like this will keep things more organized.

Bookmarklets must be a single line of text. Therefore, we can't use 
the content of this file as-is. To work around this, we'll 'minify' 
it. That is, we'll compact it and turn it into a single line.

## What to do

1. Open lesson02.js and copy the contents.
1. Visit the [Javascript Compressor](http://www.minifyjs.com/javascript-compressor/).
1. Paste the contents into the upper text box there and click 'Compress JavaScript'.
1. Copy the resulting output from the lower text box.
1. Right-click the bookmarklet you create in lesson 01 and click 'Edit...'.
1. Delete the text in the 'URL' textbox and paste the text you copied.
1. Click 'Save'.
1. Click on your updated bookmarklet.
