Hey... where's my code?!

## About

This lesson doesn't contain any code. Instead, we're going to 
learn about a very important tool for working with HTML and 
javascript.

To help programmers build better websites, Google has created 
a set of tools called Chrome Developer Tools that are built 
into the Chrome Web Browser. To acces them:

1. Open any website using Chrome.
1. Click the menu button (usually located in the upper-right corner of the browser).
1. Click 'Tools'.
1. Click 'Developer Tools'.

After doing this, you'll see a tray open at the bottom of the 
browser window. Along the top of the tray, look for the tab 
titled 'Elements'. If this is not already, selected, click it.

You're now looking at the HTML document that forms the webpage 
displayed in the browser. Notice the names of some of the 
HTML elements you see there. You might see `<html>`, `<head>`, 
`<div>`, and many more.

Play around with the tools to see what happens. Below are some 
specific steps that will cover some interesting features.

## What to do

1. Go to a webpage and open the Chrome Developer Tools.
1. Hover your mouse over the elements in the HTML document displayed in the tools tray. Notice how the browser highlights the corresponding parts of the webpage.
1. On the webpage (NOT the HTML document), try right-clicking part of the page and selecting 'Inspect element'. Notice how the developer tools jump to the corresponding part of the HTML document.
1. Try exploring the elements of the HTML document. Notice that many elements will have right-arrows next to them, which you can click to see more elements that are 'embedded' within them.
